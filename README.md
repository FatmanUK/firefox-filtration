Filter bookmarks in Firefox

If you're like me you have thousands of Firefox bookmarks and a
long-forgotten interest popped into your brain. How to find out if you
have any related bookmarks?

With this extension you will be able to filter the bookmarks for
significant tags. Since we tend not to put tags in bookmarks we will
look in titles (as well as tags, just in case). There will also be the
option to scan bookmarks and add appropriate tags automatically.

Bookmarks backup in case we clobber something. (Best to enable FF Sync
if you can.)
